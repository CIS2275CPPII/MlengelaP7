You may place a bet between $1 and however much money you have.
Then, you will have two cards dealt to you, as will the dealer.
One of the dealer's cards will be hidden.
The object of the game is to get as close to 21 as you can,
without going over. Whoever gets the closest without going over wins.
If you go over 21, you are busted and lose.
If you hit 21, you are busted and lose.
If you hit 21 exactly, with a facecard and ace, you win automatically.
You may Hit (ask for another card) or Stay (play the cards you have)
The delar is required to hit on 16 or less.
